## Background

In this blog post, we will create three charts to investigate the accessibility of charging infrastructure for disadvantaged communities. Before we proceed to the data and code, let's consider what makes this topic important.

With a rapid transition to "green economy" EV charging infrastructure has come into the spotlight. Initiatives like California's adoption of ["The Advanced Clean Cars II"](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii) in 2022 mandating all new vehicle sales in California be zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) by 2035, further turned attention to the availability of charging infrastructure. As states like Rhode Island, Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts adopted similar mandates and Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, Minnesota, and Nevada are expected to follow suit, the question in inclusivity of this transition becomes ever important. Will disadvantaged communities have equitable access to the benefits of the green economy, or will they be left behind? While high EV prices and limited availability remain primary obstacles, the lack of accessible charging infrastructure poses a challenge of its own. Insufficient charging infrastructure charging in these communities can discourage the households from adopting EVs. Furthermore, charging infrastructure offers multiple benefits to the communities where they are implemented, such as improved air quality, increased business opportunities, and higher real estate values, and etc. (refer to [DOE website](https://www.transportation.gov/rural/ev/toolkit/ev-benefits-and-challenges/community-benefits). Disadvantaged communities, in particular, stand to gain from these improvements.

## Data And Design process

### Data

I used the following data sets to address the question about **equity within EV charging network distribution and deployment in the United States**:\

**Dataset 2**. Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool.  Source: [CEJST](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5)\

## Learn about the dataset

The dataset highlights disadvantaged census tracts across the United States, and the U.S. territories for the following categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. For this infographic I used transportation categories, as well as the community's status as disadvantaged or not. Overview and metadata details:

```
:::

**Climate and Economic Justice Tool data set** variables used in modeling:

-   SF: State/Territory

-   CF: County Name

-   GEOID: Census Tract

-   TPF: Total population

-   TF_PFS: Traffic proximity and volume (percentile)

-   TP_ET: Greater than or equal to the 90th percentile for traffic proximity

-   SN_C: Definition N community, including adjacency index tracts\

**Dataset 2**. Alternative Fuels Data Center: Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations.  Source: [NREL](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all)\

::: callout-note
## Learn about the dataset

The data set is accessible via NREL maintained API and provides a list of over 70 features related to alternative fuels alternative fuels stations. For this infographic I used a subset of attributes specific to electric vehicle charging stations.
:::

**NREL API data set** variables used in modeling:

-   id: EV charger ID

-   status_code: EV charger status (available, planned)

-   ev_dc_fast_num: DC fast charging port type

-   ev_level2_evse_num: Level 2 charging port type

-   longtitude and latitude: position of an EV charging station\

::: callout-tip
## Types of charging ports

-   Level 1 connector (*out of scope from the analysis*): standardized connector primarily for home use.\
    The charge rate is 3-5 miles per hour.\
    Applicable for trips up to 40 miles or less daily.\

-   Level 2 charging port: standardized connector primarily for home or office use.\
    The charge rate is 15-30 miles per hour.\
    Applicable for trips 100+ miles daily.\

-   DC fast charging port: three connector types (CCS, CHAdeMO, NACS) connected to dedicated high power stations.\
    The charge rate is 150-400 miles per hour.\
    Applicable for trips 300+ miles daily.\
:::

### Design Decisions

1.  Define a primary and leading questions to visualize.

    My infographic explores the question, **"Is our EV charging infrastructure equitable?"**. To address this complex primary question, I divided the analysis into three separate leading questions.

    -   **Question 1**: Which of the top 5 states have the most number of EV charging ports installed or in progress to date? This helped me to target my analysis on the states that have the most data to work with.

    -   **Question 2**: Among the top 5 states from Question 1, how do the ratios of EV charging ports to state population compare with those within disadvantaged communities in the 90th percentile of traffic proximity? These communities, being near major roads with heavy traffic, are ideal candidates for EV charging infrastructure deployment due to high demand.

    -   **Question 3**: In states where disadvantaged communities in the 90th percentile of traffic proximity have fewer EV charging ports per capita compared to the state average, can we see a noticeable bias in the distribution of EV charging stations on the map?

2.  Select the graphic form to visualize each question presented in the infographic.

    -   **For Question 1**, I chose a sunburst plot to display the number of EV chargers in each state. The choice was informed by the compact layout of the sunburst plot and its ability to visualize distribution across multiple sections without overcrowding a figure. Additionally, the sunburst plot allows zooming into individual states to access statistics. ***Note**: the latter feature is available in the interactive mode only.*
    -   **For Question 2**, I selected a dumbbell plot for its effectiveness in comparing two values measured in the same units. It offers a compact layout and ease of interpretation, making it the preferred choice for visualizing the second question.
    -   **For Question 3**, I used a choropleth-style map with an inset. I made this choice to visualize the distribution of EV charging stations within different types of census tracts across the state.

3.  Decide on the design approach (theme, fonts, colors, etc.).

    -   **Text** (e.g. titles, captions, annotations, axis labels, axis ticks, alt text). For the first and second figures, I included the titles, while I relied on the legend to explain the choropleth map. I excluded the axis titles from all graphs as it was not necessary to understand the content. This allowed me to maintain clean layouts.

    -   **Themes** (i.e. all non-data plot elements). I used `theme_bw` and `theme_void` to keep the visuals clean by removing unnecessary elements such as axes from the choropleth maps or grids from the dumbbell plot.

    -   **Colors**. I opted for a pastel palette of green, pink, and yellow.

        -   Green color was used to symbolically display EV charger locations, highlighting their contrbution towards a "green" economy.

        -   Maroon color with a shade of brown was chosen to represent disadvantaged communities, subtly conveying a sense of hardship or challenges.

        -   Light yellow was chosen as the background color, complementing the visual elements and ensuring sufficient contrast between them.

    -   **Typography**. I used default fonts in my infographic to keep the layout simple and avoid distractions from the main questions. Where appropriate, I used a bold fontface and changed the size of the fonts for readability.

    -   **General design** (e.g. group order, spacing, text orientation, data-ink ratio, creating a visual hierarchy, avoiding information overload). In my infographic, my aim was to guide viewers towards answering the main question, **"Is EV infrastructure in the United States equitable?"** To achieve this, I positioned the figures to transition from an overview (sunburst plot) to more focused details (choropleth maps).

4.  Decide how to center your primary message on the infographic.

    The primary figure---a choropleth map---displays the distribution of EV chargers relative to disadvantaged communities. While it is the most critical element in answering the main question, I placed it below the other two figures to maintain a logical sequence in the narrative.

5.  Consider accessibility (e.g. colorblind-friendly palettes / contrast, alt text).

    I attempted to use colors that are accessible for viewers who have color-blindness conditions. While for most cases of color-blindness, I was able to achieve a sufficient level of contrast to view the figures, in few instances, such as monochromacy and protanipia, the contrast is lacking. I used an online color blindness [simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to verify the figures for color-blindness. To address these cases, I included an alt-text to all three visualizations.

6.  Apply a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) lens to the design (e.g. considering the people / communities / places represented in the data, framing of the questions).

    As my infographic focused on identifying bias in the deployment of EV charging infrastructure concerning disadvantaged communities, I aimed to maintain an objective tone in both my visuals and text. Specifically, I utilized a federally sponsored dataset, the "Climate and Economic Screening Tool," to identify disadvantaged communities.
