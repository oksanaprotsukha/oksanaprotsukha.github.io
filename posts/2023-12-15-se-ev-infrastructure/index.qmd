## **Overview**

In this analysis I explore inequality trends in electric vehicle (EV) charging network distribution in California. An earlier study from 2020 on this topic identified disparities across race and income in EV charging infrastructure \[1\]. However, we have seen a 136 % increase in new zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) sales and 33 % increase in charging stations deployment in California since the study was published \[2\]. In my analysis I aim to identify whether the earlier trends of inequality in EV infrastructure deployment persist.

### Research Question:

> [Are electric vehicle charging stations less likely to be installed in low-income communities in comparison to higher-income ones?]{style="color:#2a9d8f; text-align: center;"}

### Significance

Lack of EV charging infrastructure is one of the primary barriers to EV adoption among the population. The Advanced Clean Cars II regulations mandate that all new vehicle sales in California should be ZEV by 2035 \[3\]. Equitable distribution of EV charging infrastructure is critical to prevent low income and disadvantaged communities from being left behind during the transition to a [green economy]{style="color:#2a9d8f;"} in California.

### Data

I used the following two datasets in the analysis.

#### Dataset 1: Alternative Fuels Data Center: Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations.

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) maintains a comprehensive database of EV charging stations across the United States and Canada. It encompasses over 70 different attributes. Data is available to download via [API](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all) \[4\].

#### Dataset 2: The United States Environmental Protection Agency's EJScreen data.

EJScreen stands for Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool \[5\]. According to the developer's documentation "EJSCREEN is an environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators." \[6\] It includes 12 environmental indicators, 6 demographic indicators and 12 EJ indexes. The scope of the analysis was limited to the the following two socio-economic indicators:\
- proximity traffic\
- low income indicators in the\

Additional details and metadata are available on [EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen).

### Problem Setup

#### Scope

The scope of the analysis is limited to the state of California. The analysis did not include the differentiation between urban vs rural areas and didn't account for EV ownership.

#### Assumptions

-   census blocks with the ratio of 0.05% of level 2 or DC charging ports were identified as having EV charging available. This assumes there is at least 1 level 2 or DC charging port per 2000 people.
-   level 1 charging ports alone were considered insufficient for public charging infrastructure to incentivize EV ownership.

#### Terminology

-   EV: electrical vehicle\
-   EV charging station: equipment that connects an electric vehicle (EV) to a source of electricity to recharge electric cars, neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.\
-   Charging port: the system within a charger that charges one EV. A charging port may have multiple connectors, but it can provide power to charge only one EV through one connector at a time. One charging station can have multiple ports.\

#### Method

1.  Set up hypotheses: NULL and Alternative.\
2.  Perform data exploration to identify an optimal dependent variable.\
3.  Define statistical model

-   Apply linear model with multi-beta parameters and check the model fit.
-   Apply logistical (binary) model with multi-beta parameters if linear model fit is not suitable.\

### Limitations

-   Parameters such as EV ownership, approvals process, grid infrastructure were not included in the analysis.
-   Only income was used as a socio-economic indicator.

## Analysis

### Hypothesis

The analysis is based on the following hypotheses:

**H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: Income level does not have an impact on EV charging infrastructure within a census block area, even when controlling for proximity to traffic.

**HA (Alternative Hypothesis)**: The probability that EV charging infrastructure is available within a census block area with a higher level of low-income households is lower, even when controlling for proximity to traffic.

### Setup

```{r global_options, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
options(scipen = 999) # disable scientific notation

# set your file path here
rootdir <- "/Users/oksi/workspace/se_ev_charging_analysis/"

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

I used the following libraries throughout the analysis:

```{r setup, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true

library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(readr)
library(gt)
library(openintro)
library(ggplot2)
library(modelr)
library(lterdatasampler)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(maptiles)
library(kableExtra)
library(janitor)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r api_keys, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load common functionalities
# source(file.path(rootdir, '_common.R'))

# Load configuration
source(file.path(rootdir, 'config.R'))

# Retrieve API Key
api_key <- NREL_API_KEY
```

### Data wrangling and exploration

To start, I downloaded the two datasets from NREL and EPA EJScreen (refer to the data section). Since both datasets had spacial attributes and no other attributes in common, I used spatial joins and subsetting to combine them into a single dataset. Following this, I converted the final dataset into a dataframe by eliminating geometries. This allows to enhance performance of the subsequent steps by reducing the number of datapoints to process.

#### EV charging data import and wrangling:

```{r ev_data_import, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true

# Get charging stations for California
# Specify API endpoint and parameters
api_url <- "https://developer.nrel.gov/api/alt-fuel-stations/v1"

api_params <- list(
  format = "json",  
  api_key = api_key, 
  status = "E",  # E = charging stations in operation
  access = "public",
  fuel_type = "ELEC",
  cng_vehicle_class = "LD", # LD = light duty vehicles
  country = "US",
  state = "CA",
  limit = "all"
)

# Construct the full URL with parameters
request_url <- modify_url(api_url, query = api_params)

# Make a GET request to the API
response <- GET(request_url)

# Extract the fuel_stations data from the response
fuel_stations_df <- content(response, "parsed")$fuel_stations

# Convert the list to a dataframe
fuel_stations_df <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, fuel_stations_df)) 

# Select the fields for analysis
fuel_stations_df_clean <- fuel_stations_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(fuel_type_code)) %>% 
  select('id', 'access_code','owner_type_code', 'open_date', 'restricted_access', 'maximum_vehicle_class','facility_type', 'city','state','zip','ev_workplace_charging', 'ev_level1_evse_num', 'ev_level2_evse_num', 'ev_dc_fast_num' , 'longitude', 'latitude')

# Convert data frame to sf object
fuel_stations_sf <- fuel_stations_df_clean %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# identify which points are outside the boundarie of California
california_bbox <- st_bbox(c(xmin = -124.409591, ymin = 32.534156, 
                             xmax = -114.131211, ymax = 42.009518), 
                           crs = st_crs(fuel_stations_sf))

ca_ev_sf <- fuel_stations_sf %>% 
  st_set_crs(st_crs(california_bbox)) %>%  # Set CRS to the same as your data
  st_crop(california_bbox)  # Crop to the bounding box of California

```

#### EJScreen data import and wrangling:

```{r ejscreen_data_import, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true

# read in geodatabase of EJScreen data at the Census Block Group level
ejscreen <- st_read(file.path(rootdir,'/data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb/'))
ejscreen_meta <- st_read(file.path(rootdir, "data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_Columns.xlsx"))

# transform ejscreen into sf object
ejscreen_sf <- st_as_sf(ejscreen)

# clean ejscreen
ejscreen_sf_clean <- ejscreen_sf %>% 
  select('ID', 'STATE_NAME', 'ST_ABBREV', 'CNTY_NAME', 'PTRAF', 'P_PTRAF', 'P_LOWINCPCT', 'LOWINCOME','LOWINCPCT', 'ACSTOTPOP', 'P_UNEMPPCT', 'P_PEOPCOLORPCT', 'P_UNEMPPCT', 'P_PNPL', 'P_PRMP', 'P_PTSDF') %>% 
  rename(census_block_id = 'ID') %>% 
  clean_names()

# filter EJ to California state 
ejscreen_ca_sf <- ejscreen_sf_clean %>% 
  filter(state_name == 'California')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ca_ev <- ca_ev_sf

# reproject CRS
ca_ev <- ca_ev %>% st_transform(crs = st_crs(ejscreen_sf_clean))

# fix invalid geometries
ejscreen_ca_sf <- st_make_valid(ejscreen_ca_sf)

# subset EV charging map to the stations within California
ca_ev <- ca_ev[ejscreen_ca_sf, ] %>% 
  distinct()

# join ev charging and ejscreen datasets
ca_ev_joined <- st_join(ejscreen_ca_sf, ca_ev)

# drop geometries for further analysis 
ca_ev_df <- ca_ev_joined %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  distinct() # remove duplicate rows

# convert NULL values to NAs
ca_ev_df[ca_ev_df == "NULL"] <- NA

# calculate number of charging stations per number of people in each census block
# rough assumptions: we want 0.05% - 0.1% of charging ports per capita
# exclude level 1 ports from the dataset
# to simplify we are going to apply this ratio state-wide
ports_per_capita_excl_level1 <- ca_ev_df %>%
  group_by(census_block_id) %>%
  mutate(
    total_ports = any(!sapply(list(ev_dc_fast_num, ev_level2_evse_num, ev_level1_evse_num), is.na)),
    total_ports_per_block = sum(
      ifelse(!is.na(ev_dc_fast_num), as.numeric(ev_dc_fast_num), 0),
      ifelse(!is.na(ev_level2_evse_num), as.numeric(ev_level2_evse_num), 0)
    ),
    total_ports_capita_pct = (sum(total_ports_per_block) / sum(acstotpop, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()

# remove extra variables
ports_per_capita_excl_level1_clean <- ports_per_capita_excl_level1 %>% 
  select(census_block_id, id, total_ports, 
         total_ports_per_block,  total_ports_capita_pct, p_ptraf, p_lowincpct)

# handle NA and Inf values
ports_per_capita_excl_level1_clean <- ports_per_capita_excl_level1_clean[is.finite(ports_per_capita_excl_level1_clean$total_ports_capita_pct), ]
```

Before proceeding to the modeling steps, I visualized the data to ensure that we are working with the accurate datasets.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# plot ev charging stations distribution in California state
ev_by_road_proximity <- ejscreen_ca_sf %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = p_ptraf), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", name = "Proximity to Traffic (Percentile)") +
  geom_sf(data = ca_ev, color = "red", size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "EV Charging Infrastructure by Road Proximity",
       fill = "Proximity to Traffic")

ev_by_income <- ejscreen_ca_sf %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = p_lowincpct), color = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", name = "Low-Income Percentage (Percentile)") +
  geom_sf(data = ca_ev, color = "red", size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "EV Charing Infrastructure by Low-Income Percentile",
       fill = "Low-Income Percentage")

ev_by_road_proximity

ev_by_income
```

### Statistical Modeling

In order to proceed with the modeling, I added a new binary variable to the dataset to define whether a given census block had or didn't have EV charging available:

```{r binary_response_var, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Set census blocks that have at least 0.05% of level 2 or DS ports per capita to 1, else to 0
ports_per_capita_clean_logit <- ports_per_capita_excl_level1_clean %>%
  mutate(chargers_available_per_capita = case_when(
    total_ports_capita_pct > 0.05 ~ 1,
    total_ports_per_block <= 0.05 ~ 0
  )) %>% 
  select(-id,-total_ports) %>% 
  na.omit

```

```{r final_dataframe, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(ports_per_capita_clean_logit),caption='EV Charging Availability per Census Block, California',
      col.names = c("Census Block ID","Total Ports per Block", "Total Ports Capita Pct", "P_ptraf", "P_lowincpct", "EVSE Available"))
```

#### Basic data visualization

To visualize the distribution of EV infrastructure across the percentiles for low income and proximity to traffic, I used histogram:

```{r echo=FALSE}
g1 <- ggplot(data = ports_per_capita_clean_logit, 
             aes(x = p_lowincpct, fill = as.factor(chargers_available_per_capita))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Charging Infastructure availability across income percentiles",
       x = "Low-income percentile",
       y = "Frequency",
       fill = "EV Charging Available")

g2 <- ggplot(data = ports_per_capita_clean_logit, 
             aes(x = p_ptraf, fill = as.factor(chargers_available_per_capita))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Charging Infastructure availability across proximity to traffic percentiles",
       x = "Proximity to traffic percentile",
       y = "Frequency",
       fill = "EV Charging Available")

g1 / g2
```

From the graphs, we observe a marginal decrease in available EV infrastructure as the percentile of low-income households within a census block increases. Additionally, there is a substantial increase in the availability of EV charging infrastructure with closer proximity to traffic.\

Let's run logarithmic regression to confirm whether out intuition is correct.

```{r multi_beta_logit, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

mod_ev_multi = glm(chargers_available_per_capita~p_lowincpct+p_ptraf, 
                   data = ports_per_capita_clean_logit, family = 'binomial')

gg = ggplot(data = ports_per_capita_clean_logit, aes(x = p_lowincpct, y = chargers_available_per_capita)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.8, size = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()

log_g <- gg + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'glm', se = FALSE, color = 'red', 
              method.args = list(family = 'binomial')) +
  labs(x = "Low-Income Percentile", y = "EV Chargering Available")
```

#### Interpretation:

```{r echo=FALSE}
log_g
kable(tidy(mod_ev_multi), format = "markdown", caption = 'Coefficients')
```

**Coefficients**:

-   Intercept: according to the model, when both low income percent percentile and proximity to traffic percentile are zero, the estimated log-odds of EV infrastructure availability in a given census block is -1.15683. This intuitively makes sense, since we typically would not expect the need of EV charging (or it would be very low) if a census block is remote.\

-   p_lowincpct: this indicates that with 1 percentile increase in low-income percent percentile in a census block controlling for proximity to traffic percentile, we estimate -0.00549 change in log-odds of EV charging availability. Again, this makes sense and alignes with our Alternative Hypothesis. In general, we would expect few EV charging stations in low-income communities.\

-   p_ptraf: this indicates that with 1 percentile increase in proximity to traffic percentile in a census block controlling for low-income percent percentile, we estimate 0.01919 change in log-odds of EV charging availability. This alignes with our experience and intuition, since we usually expect more EV charging stations in close proximity to traffic.

-   **p-value**: p-value is are well below 0.05 significance level, indicating high statistical significance of all the coefficients in predicting the availability of EV charging infrastructure. Therefore, we can **reject the Null Hypothesis** and conclude that there is a relationship between a low-income and ev charging infrastructure availability even when controlling for proximity to traffic.

### Findings

According to the regression results, we can conclude that the probability of having EV charging infrastructure in the census blocks with more low-income households is lower in comparison to higher income census blocks. However, the values of the coefficients are low and from the graphs we observe that there is a rather small gap in EV infrastructure availability based on income distribution.

Additional analysis is required to confirm the findings by including other variables in the model, such as race, unemployment, EV ownership ratio.
